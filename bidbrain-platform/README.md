# bidbrain-platform — the front-door (dashboards.bidbrain.ai)

One password box in front of all the client dashboards. It does **not** hold or show any client
data — it's a thin Flask gate + an editable registry of agencies → clients → campaigns, stored
as a single **private JSON object in GCS** (`gs://bidbrain-analytics-platform-dash/platform.json`)
— the same private-bucket pattern every dashboard uses, no database. Same serving pattern as every
other dash in this repo (gunicorn, `no-store`, private, `--no-invoker-iam-check`).

## What a password does (resolved against the registry by `store.resolve_password`)
| You type… | You get… |
|---|---|
| an **agency** password (e.g. `100d2026`) | a portal of every dashboard in that agency; click any to open it with **no further password** |
| a single **dashboard** password | straight to that one dashboard |
| the **admin** password | the editable admin tree (add/edit/remove agencies, clients, campaigns) |
| the **super-admin** password | the **god-mode console** — reveal AND rotate every password + open any dashboard. See [Super admin](#super-admin-god-mode-console) below. |

**Enter agency view (admin & super).** From the admin tree (each agency's **Enter portal →**) or the
god-mode console (**Enter agency portal →**), an admin/super can step into any agency's own portal —
exactly what that agency sees, correctly scoped. It flips the session to that `agency` kind (reusing
every agency-scoped path: the portal, `/api/status`, the proxy's `_may_open`) and stashes the role to
restore; the portal then shows a **▸ Viewing agency portal** pill and a **← Back to admin / super
console** link (`GET /enter-agency/<slug>` · `GET /exit-agency`). Log out clears everything.

### Agencies (seeded from `dash/config.py`)
- **100% Digital** (`100d2026`): City Perfume, VMCH, The Little Marionette, ResetData,
  Bell Shakespeare *(coming soon)*, Geocon *(coming soon)*.
- **Transmission** (`transmission2026`): Schneider Electric, Cloudflare, PropTrack, MongoDB, STT,
  Pipeline Status *(the meta `status-dash`, surfaced here so Transmission can watch data health;
  proxied like any client — the platform SA has `secretAccessor` on `status-dash-password`)*.
- **Unassigned** (not in any agency, reachable only by their own dashboard password): **HireRight**.
  Add clients to an agency anytime via the admin UI.

The **admin agencies page** (`templates/admin.html`) renders these as per-agency **accordion cards**
(collapsed by default; open state kept client-side in `sessionStorage`) in the house style, each
with each agency's **dark logo tile** from `ADMIN_AGENCY_LOGOS` — a black-ground badge loaded from
`admlogo_<slug>.svg/.jpg/.png` in `dash/`, **admin-page only and separate from the portal's
`AGENCY_LOGOS`** so the two surfaces can differ (the route passes it to the template as `agency_logos`;
falls back to initials on a neutral tile) — plus a name/client **search box**. Every action (Enter
portal / Add client / Edit / Delete / + Campaign / Logo / Remove / Sync all) and its endpoint is
unchanged — the redesign (2026-07-02) is presentation only.

**House accent = bright cornflower blue** `--accent:#4C8DFF` / `--accent-strong:#6EA8FF` (+ 12% tint),
with a subtle blue top-glow. It's declared per-file in each template's `:root`, so a re-theme means
editing **`templates/login.html`, `templates/admin.html`, and the `_FEEDBACK_ADMIN_HTML` string in
`main.py`**. `templates/_status_merge.html` is SHARED with the portal and keeps its own semantic
palette (blue = Snowflake, teal = dashboard, green = healthy/match); the admin view only overrides its
active-tab underline to the accent. Semantic status colours (Completed = green, etc.) are kept separate
from the accent.

Admin password defaults to `bidbrain-admin-2026` — override with the `ADMIN_PW` env before
seeding, or rotate later by re-seeding with a new `ADMIN_PW`.

## Super admin (god-mode console)
The **super-admin** password opens `templates/superadmin.html` — a gold-themed console headed
**“WELCOME, SUPER ADMIN”** that does three things no other tier can:

1. **Reveal every password** — each agency password, each dashboard's real login, and the admin
   password, shown masked with a click-to-reveal eye + copy button.
2. **Rotate any password** — inline “Change”. Agency/admin/super passwords are stored in the private
   registry (instant). A **dashboard** password is *true* rotation: it writes a new
   `<c>-dash-password` Secret Manager version **and restarts that `<c>-dash` service** so the new
   password takes effect for the standalone dashboard everywhere (the dashboard is briefly
   unavailable, ~20–40s, while it restarts). The platform's own proxy cache is updated in-process.
3. **Open any dashboard** — same one-click, no-second-password access as admin.
   It also links to the full admin tree at `/admin` (super admin inherits every admin power).

**How revealing is possible.** Passwords were previously stored only as one-way pbkdf2 hashes — a hash
can't be un-hashed. The registry now keeps a recoverable `password_plain` *beside* each hash (it lives
only in the **private** GCS registry — the same trust boundary that already holds every dashboard's
plaintext `<c>-dash-password` secret). A registry seeded before this feature is hash-only;
`Store.backfill_plaintext` self-heals it on first super-admin load by recovering any seed value
(from `config.py`) that still verifies against the stored hash. Anything rotated away from its seed
value stays hidden until the super admin sets it explicitly in the console.

**Login resolution.** `store.resolve_password` checks super admin **first**: against the registry
`super_admin_password_hash` if set, else the bootstrap `SUPER_ADMIN_PW` env (Secret Manager
`platform-super-admin-password`) so the login works the moment the secret is mounted, before any
re-seed. Setting a super password in the console moves it into the registry and the env fallback stops.

> **Gotcha — two passwords open one dashboard, and they are NOT auto-synced.** A *single-dashboard*
> front-door login (`resolve_password` → `('client', c)`) verifies the typed password against the
> **registry** `clients[<key>].password_hash`. That is a DIFFERENT credential from the dashboard's own
> `<c>-dash-password` Secret Manager value (used for direct `…run.app` access **and** the server-side
> proxy login). They start equal because both are seeded from `config.CLIENT_PASSWORDS[<key>]`, but
> rotating one does NOT update the other: the super-admin "rotate dashboard password" (and a manual
> `gcloud secrets versions add <c>-dash-password`) only touches the **secret**. To change the password
> a user types at `dashboards.bidbrain.ai` to open just that dashboard, update the **registry** hash
> too — load `gs://bidbrain-analytics-platform-dash/platform.json`, set
> `clients[<key>].password_hash` = `store.hash_pw(new)` (and `password_plain` = new), save. Keep both
> in sync if you want one password everywhere.

**Enabling it (one-time, after deploying the new image):**
```powershell
.\bidbrain-platform\dash\deploy_dash_platform.ps1      # ships the console + the google-cloud-run dep
.\scripts\enable_super_admin.ps1 -SuperPw 'a-strong-password'   # IAM + bootstrap secret + env mount
```
`enable_super_admin.ps1` creates `platform-super-admin-password`, mounts `SUPER_ADMIN_PW`+`REGION` on
the platform service, and grants the platform SA the extra IAM dashboard rotation needs:
`secretmanager.secretVersionAdder` on each `<c>-dash-password`, project `run.developer` (create a new
`<c>-dash` revision), and `iam.serviceAccountUser` on each `<c>-dash` runtime SA (actAs, required to
deploy the revision). **There is no committed default super-admin password** — pass `-SuperPw`, or omit
it and the script generates a strong random one and prints it **once** (save it; the config default is
empty so an unconfigured deploy fails *closed*, never open). Change it any time in the console (that
moves it into the registry and supersedes the secret). If a dashboard rotation's auto-restart ever
fails (e.g. IAM not yet propagated), the console tells you the exact `gcloud run services update …` to
finish it by hand.

## Sign in with Google (native, alongside the password)
Users can log in **either** with a password **or** with their Google account — Google sign-in is an
**additive** second path that never replaces the password box. It's off until you switch it on
(`GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` unset ⇒ the button is hidden and `/auth/google` is disabled; passwords keep
working exactly as before).

**How it works.** The login page renders Google's official **GIS button**; the browser posts the
signed **ID token (JWT)** to the platform's `/auth/google` via a *same-origin fetch*. The server
verifies the JWT against the OAuth **client id** (the JWT `aud`) with `google-auth`
(`id_token.verify_oauth2_token`), checks `email_verified`, then maps the **verified email** to a role
with `store.resolve_email` — the email twin of `resolve_password`, with the same four outcomes. The
OAuth **client id is public** (it ships in the login HTML) and there is **no client secret** — the
signed JWT is the proof, so there's nothing secret to leak and no redirect flow to configure. The
same-origin fetch sidesteps third-party-cookie / `SameSite` issues entirely.

**Who gets in.** Only an email that's been granted access resolves; every other Google account is
rejected *after* a valid sign-in (a clear "not authorised — ask an admin" message). The allow-list is
the registry's **`users`** map:

| email mapped to… | opens… |
|---|---|
| `superadmin` | the god-mode console |
| `admin` | the agencies → clients → campaigns tree |
| `agency` (+ `agency_slug`) | that agency's portal |
| `client` (+ `client_key`) | just that one dashboard |

`ian@100.digital` is the **baked-in super admin** (config `USERS`) — it always resolves even on a
pre-existing registry (config fallback in `resolve_email`, the same fail-safe idea as the
`SUPER_ADMIN_PW` env), so you can never lock it out; deleting it in the UI can't actually revoke it
(it's shown as "baked-in — permanent"). Manage everyone else in the super-admin console's **"Google
sign-in access"** panel: add an email, pick a role, and (for agency/client) pick the target. Emails
match case-insensitively.

**Domain auto-admin (`@100.digital`).** So the whole team doesn't have to be added one email at a
time, any verified Google email whose **domain** is in `config.ADMIN_EMAIL_DOMAINS` (default
`100.digital`; override with the comma-separated `ADMIN_EMAIL_DOMAINS` env, empty ⇒ feature off) is
granted the **admin** role automatically:
- `resolve_email` has a **domain fallback** — when an email has *no* explicit `users`/seed record and
  its domain matches, it resolves to `admin`. This makes the very *first* sign-in succeed (no 403).
- `/auth/google` then calls **`store.record_domain_admin(email)`**, which writes that email into the
  registry `users` map as `admin` — so it shows up in the "Google sign-in access" panel like any other
  account and can be **re-scoped or removed** there. (Removing it just re-grants admin on the next
  sign-in while the domain rule is on; to truly restrict someone, re-scope them to `client`/`agency` —
  an explicit record always beats the domain fallback.)
- **Precedence:** explicit registry row → config `USERS` seed → domain fallback. So the seed super
  admin `ian@100.digital` stays **superadmin** (never downgraded), and `record_domain_admin` no-ops for
  any email that already has a record. Match is **exact domain** — `x@evil.100.digital` (a subdomain)
  does *not* match `100.digital`. Trust rests on `100.digital` being a **Google Workspace domain the
  company controls** (Google verifies domain ownership and we require `email_verified`), so a stranger
  can't mint a `@100.digital` Google account.

**Switch it on (one-time).** The OAuth client can't be created with gcloud — make it in the Console,
then inject its id:
```powershell
# 1. Console -> APIs & Services -> Credentials -> Create credentials -> OAuth client ID ->
#    "Web application"; Authorized JavaScript origin: https://dashboards.bidbrain.ai
#    (+ the raw https://platform-dash-...run.app). NO redirect URI (GIS button + same-origin fetch).
# 2. Inject the client id (re-runnable; password login unaffected):
.\scripts\enable_google_login.ps1 -ClientId '1234...apps.googleusercontent.com'
```

## Sign in with Microsoft (Teams / M365 — the twin of Google)
The exact same additive pattern for the team's Microsoft world. A **"Sign in with Microsoft"** button
sits **beneath** the Google button (a "Sign in with Teams" login is just a Microsoft **work/school
account** — there's no separate Teams identity, so the button carries Microsoft's standard label). Off
until switched on: it needs **both** `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` **and** `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_TENANT`
(single-tenant); either unset ⇒ the button is hidden and `/auth/microsoft` is inert (password + Google
unaffected).

**How it works.** The login page loads **MSAL.js** and, on click, opens a Microsoft **login popup**
that returns a signed **ID token (JWT)**; the browser posts it to `/auth/microsoft` (same-origin fetch).
The server verifies it with **PyJWT** against the tenant's **JWKS** (`.../{tenant}/discovery/v2.0/keys`)
— RS256 signature, `aud` = our client id, `exp`, and the issuer pinned to
`https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tid}/v2.0` (plus `tid` == our tenant when the tenant is given as a
GUID) — then maps the **verified email** (`email`, else the UPN in `preferred_username`) to a role with
the **same `store.resolve_email`**. So password / Google / Microsoft are identical from
`_establish_session` on, and the allow-list (registry `users` map) is **shared** — one grant works for
either provider. Public-client model like Google: **no client secret**, the signed JWT is the proof.

**Single-tenant is the safety.** `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_TENANT` is **our own Entra tenant** (its GUID, or a
verified domain). It pins both the authority the button talks to and the issuer/`tid` the server
accepts, so **only our organisation's accounts** can sign in — which is what makes the `@100.digital`
**domain auto-admin** rule (shared with Google, via `record_domain_admin`) safe over Microsoft: a
foreign tenant can't mint a token our tenant-scoped keys will verify. A work/school UPN is
org-controlled, so it's authoritative — that's why no `email_verified` claim is required (Microsoft ID
tokens don't carry one; Google's do, hence the asymmetry in the two routes).

**Switch it on (one-time).** The app registration can't be created with gcloud — make it in Entra,
then inject the two ids:
```powershell
# 1. entra.microsoft.com -> App registrations -> New registration; "single tenant";
#    Redirect URI platform = "Single-page application (SPA)": https://dashboards.bidbrain.ai
#    (+ the raw https://platform-dash-...run.app). Copy the Application (client) ID + Directory (tenant) ID.
# 2. Inject both (re-runnable; password + Google login unaffected):
.\scripts\enable_microsoft_login.ps1 -ClientId '<application-client-id>' -Tenant '<directory-tenant-id>'
```

## How "no second password" works TODAY — a reverse proxy
The platform is live on the custom domain **https://dashboards.bidbrain.ai**. The individual
dashboards have **no** `<c>.bidbrain.ai` subdomains, and a shared SSO cookie can't span raw `run.app`
hosts (public-suffix). So the platform **reverse-proxies** each dashboard under its own origin:

- Portal/admin tiles link to **`/d/<client>/`** (not the dashboard's run.app URL).
- `proxy()` in `main.py` checks your platform session may open that client, then forwards to the
  upstream `https://<c>-dash-…run.app/`, logging in **once per instance** with that dashboard's own
  password (read from Secret Manager `<c>-dash-password`; the platform SA has `secretAccessor`). The
  upstream session cookie is cached and reused; the dashboard's **absolute same-origin paths are
  rewritten** to `/d/<client>/…` so they stay inside the proxy: `/data.json`, mongodb's `'/report'`,
  and `/creative-img/` (resetdata's cached creative-gallery images). **GOTCHA:** any NEW absolute path a
  dashboard fetches (an `<img src="/…">`, a `fetch('/…')`) MUST be added to this rewrite list in
  `proxy()` — otherwise it resolves to the platform ROOT through the proxy and 404s (works only on the
  raw run.app URL, which hides the bug). This is exactly what broke resetdata's creative previews.
- `proxy()` also **injects a floating "Log out" pill** (`_LOGOUT_BUTTON`, fully inline-styled, max
  z-index) into the bottom of every proxied dashboard page — the dashboards have no logout of their
  own. It links to the platform's `/logout` (root-relative, so `dashboards.bidbrain.ai/logout`, NOT
  through `/d/`), which clears the session + `bb_sso` cookie exactly like the portal/admin pages.
- Result: after the single platform login, dashboards just open — **no second password** — all on the
  one `dashboards.bidbrain.ai` origin. Per-agency scoping is enforced on `/d/<client>/`.

The `bb_sso` cookie machinery below is also deployed but **inert**. The platform itself now has a custom
domain, but the cookie path would only take over if each *dashboard* got its own `<c>.bidbrain.ai`
subdomain too (then you'd switch the registry URLs to `https://<c>.<domain>/`) — today they don't, so it
stays dormant.

## (Future) cookie-based SSO once a domain exists
The dashboards were already built for this: each sets `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=None; Secure`, but
its session cookie is **host-only** (won't span subdomains). So the platform issues a **separate**
signed cookie:

- On login the platform sets **`bb_sso`** — a timed, signed (`itsdangerous`) token listing the
  client keys you may open — scoped to the parent domain **`.bidbrain.ai`** so it reaches every
  `<c>.bidbrain.ai`.
- Each dashboard's `authed()` was extended (additively, fail-safe) to also accept that cookie
  **iff this client key is in the list** — see the vendored `platform_sso.py` in every
  `clients/client_<c>/dash/`. Per-agency scoping is real: a 100% Digital token never lists
  Transmission's clients. **The dashboard's own password always remains a valid fallback**, so
  this can never lock anyone out, and a dashboard deployed before SSO is wired just ignores it.

Signing keys: `platform-sso-key` (shared, in Secret Manager — the platform signs, every
dashboard verifies) and `platform-dash-session-key` (the platform's own session). **Don't rotate
`platform-sso-key` casually** — it invalidates every live SSO session across all dashboards.

**Two preconditions for SSO to actually fire** (until both hold, dashboards just use their own
password — nothing breaks): each dashboard must (1) run the rebuilt image that contains
`platform_sso.py` + the extended `authed()`, and (2) be served on `<c>.bidbrain.ai` (a raw
`*.run.app` host never receives a `.bidbrain.ai` cookie).

## Feedback (every dashboard: text / voice / screenshot, with AI interpretation)
A small **Feedback** pill is injected into the bottom-right of every proxied dashboard — the exact
same `</body>`-injection mechanism as the logout pill, so all 10 dashboards get it from ONE
`platform-dash` deploy (no per-client work). The panel lets a viewer **type a note**, **record a
voice message** (`MediaRecorder`), or both, plus an OPTIONAL **reporter name** and **preferred
deadline** (date); on open it also grabs a **page screenshot** (lazy-loaded `html2canvas`, viewport
only, the widget hidden from the shot). It POSTs to the platform's `/feedback` (`reporter`/`deadline`
ride along as plain form fields; both stored on the record, blank when not given).

- **Auth:** `/feedback` uses the same `_may_open(client)` check as the proxy — you can only file
  feedback against a dashboard you're allowed to open. The client key is baked into the widget per
  dashboard at injection time.
- **Storage (no email yet):** `feedback.save()` writes to the platform's OWN private bucket —
  `gs://bidbrain-analytics-platform-dash/feedback/<client>/<ts>-<id>.json` plus the recording
  (`.webm`/`.m4a`) and the screenshot (`.jpg`) when present. Same private-bucket trust boundary as
  the registry; `storage.objectAdmin` on `platform-dash-web@` already covers it — no new storage IAM.
- **AI transcription + interpretation:** `feedback_ai.py` makes ONE Gemini call
  (`gemini-2.5-flash`) that transcribes the voice note (Gemini accepts the browser's `audio/webm`
  inline — no Cloud Speech-to-Text, no transcoding) AND interprets the feedback into a short summary
  + concrete action items. It runs **lazily on the `/feedback/admin` view** (bounded to 15 calls per
  load) and is **cached back into the record** (`transcript`/`ai_summary`/`ai_actions`/`ai_done`), so
  it costs one call per note. Needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` (secret `gemini-api-key`, granted to
  `platform-dash-web@` + mounted on the service); if unset, notes still store and just show no summary.
  **Gotcha (fixed 2026-06-24):** `gemini-2.5-flash` spends *thinking* tokens out of `maxOutputTokens`,
  so the old `maxOutputTokens:1024` got eaten on a LONG transcript and the JSON came back truncated
  (`Unterminated string` → `json.loads` raised → the note never set `ai_done` → stuck on "Processing
  on next load…" forever, retrying each view). `interpret()` now sends `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget:0`
  + `maxOutputTokens:4096` and `_parse_json()` tolerates a truncated reply (salvages whatever fields
  finished). Short notes were unaffected — that's why only the one long resetdata note was stuck.
- **Track it:** sign in as **admin/super** → **`/feedback/admin`** (also a "Feedback →" link in the
  super-admin/admin top bars). Every note newest-first in three columns — **Notes** (the editable
  typed text + voice transcript + audio player) · **AI summary** (interpretation + action items) ·
  **Screenshot** (thumbnail → full image). Audio/images stream via `/feedback/file/<client>/<f>`,
  which honors HTTP **Range** (`Accept-Ranges`/`206`) so the player can seek. MediaRecorder `.webm`
  voice notes carry **no duration in their header** (the player would show `0:00 / 0:00`), so the
  admin page forces a seek-to-end on `loadedmetadata` to make the browser compute the real length,
  then rewinds (`audio.vn` handler); `<audio preload="metadata">` loads it up front (fixed 2026-06-24).
- **Triage:** each note has a **status** dropdown (`feedback.STATUSES` = Not yet started → Ongoing →
  On Hold → Completed; new notes default to the first) → `POST /feedback/status`, and a **Delete**
  button → `POST /feedback/delete` (removes the JSON + audio + screenshot, which share the rid prefix).
  A **filter bar** at the top of the tracker filters the cards by **status, agency (100% Digital /
  Transmission / Unassigned) and client** — each dropdown lists only values present in the notes, with
  a live count chip; client-side only (the three AND-combine), re-counts as you change a status or
  delete a note. Agency membership comes from the registry (`agency_of` client→agency map). The
  tracker was restyled to the house palette (2026-07-02).
- **Hand-edit (admin/super):** an edit bar on each note makes the human fields fully editable — the
  **reporter** name, **two dates** (`date_reported`, defaulting to the submission day, and the
  **target deadline**), and the **Notes** text — saved via `POST /feedback/edit` (merges only the
  posted keys; dates are the browser's `YYYY-MM-DD` strings or `""`). The AI summary/actions and
  transcript stay read-only (they're derived; `ai_done` keeps Gemini from re-running on an edit).
- **Caps:** voice 2 min; the service rejects bodies over `MAX_AUDIO_BYTES + MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` (~24 MB);
  an oversized screenshot is dropped rather than failing the note.
- **Wiring:** `feedback.py` (storage) + `feedback_ai.py` (Gemini) + `_FEEDBACK_WIDGET` / `_enrich()` /
  the `/feedback*` routes in `dash/main.py`. Email/Slack alerting to ian@100.digital is a deliberate
  TODO — drop it into `feedback_submit()` after `feedback.save()`.
- **Caveats:** delivered via the PROXY, so it appears on dashboards opened through the platform
  (the normal path), not on a raw `<c>-dash` run.app URL. The screenshot is an html2canvas DOM
  re-render (Chart.js canvases capture fine; the odd web-font/cross-origin image may render
  imperfectly) and `html2canvas` is lazy-loaded from a CDN — if blocked, the note just sends without
  an image. Both are vendorable later if needed.

## Open slides (AI decks — the "Open slides" button)

The agency portal's **Overview** tab shows a per-client **"Open slides"** button (rendered only for
clients in `SLIDES_CLIENTS` in `dash/main.py` = {mongodb, cloudflare, schneider, proptrack, geocon}). It
replaces the old in-dashboard toolbar button — the deck is now reachable **only from the agency login**.

**Flow (all same-origin, no new server machinery on the platform):**
1. Click → the portal opens the client's dashboard in a **hidden iframe** at `/d/<c>/?bbslides=1` (the
   reverse proxy already logs into the upstream and serves it same-origin).
2. The dashboard, seeing `?bbslides=1`, runs headless: `buildDeckPayload()` assembles the **full-flight**
   `summary` (mirroring the dashboard's own aggregators, so the deck can never disagree with the screen),
   POSTs it to `/report`, then calls the shared **`bb_deck.js`** builder.
3. `/report` (on the client's `<c>-dash`, `report.py`) runs a two-stage **Claude Opus 4.8** call —
   web-research analyst notes → strict slide JSON — with a **Gemini fallback**, cached in the client's
   bucket under `reports/` keyed by view identity + data version (so re-downloads cost no model calls).
4. `bb_deck.js` builds a 4-slide `.pptx` (Cover · What happened · Why · Recommended actions) in the
   **MongoDB brand deck's design language** (serif headlines, "ALL CAPS" mono accent pills, organic
   corner blobs, logo top-right, dark cover + light content), **recoloured per client** from a `BB_THEME`
   const in each `dashboard.html`. It returns the `.pptx` as a **Blob**; the iframe `postMessage`s it to
   the portal.
5. The portal shows a **chooser modal** (`#slidesModal` in `portal.html`) with two actions:
   - **Open in Google Slides** — a **browser-side** Google OAuth *token* flow (`google.accounts.oauth2`
     from the GIS library, reusing the platform's existing `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`) requests the
     `drive.file` scope, uploads the `.pptx` Blob straight to the signed-in user's **own** Google Drive as
     a **native Google Slides** doc (Drive multipart upload with `mimeType:
     application/vnd.google-apps.presentation` → Drive converts it), and opens the resulting presentation
     in a **new tab**. No server secrets, no service account, nothing link-shared — the deck lives in the
     user's Drive. Requires the **Drive API** enabled (it is) and the **`drive.file` scope** allowed on
     that OAuth client's consent screen (an *Internal* consent screen needs no verification). The button
     is only rendered when `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` is set (else the modal is Download-only).
   - **Download .pptx** — downloads the Blob directly (the original behavior).

**Vendored, config-driven.** `bb_deck.js` (one canonical copy in `clients/client_mongodb/dash/`) and the
generic `report.py` are copied into each participating dash; `report.py`'s per-client `CONFIG` block
(client / currency / business model / guardrails / category tokens) is the only thing that differs.
**Provisioning:** each client needs `dash/enable_report_<c>.ps1` run once (binds `secretAccessor` on the
shared `anthropic-api-key`/`gemini-api-key`, `objectAdmin` on its data bucket, mounts the keys, bumps
`--timeout` to 900) then a normal `deploy_dash_<c>.ps1`. To add a client: give its dash a `report.py`
(CONFIG), `buildDeckPayload()` + `BB_THEME` + the `?bbslides=1` bootstrap, the `/report` + `/bb_deck.js`
routes, copy `bb_deck.js`, and add its key to `SLIDES_CLIENTS`.

## Deploy & operate
```powershell
# First-time standup (idempotent). DONE — platform is LIVE at:
#   https://dashboards.bidbrain.ai  (custom domain on the platform-dash service; also on its raw
#   https://platform-dash-p32gk2wuia-ts.a.run.app URL). Tiles open each dashboard at /d/<client>/.
.\bidbrain-platform\deploy_platform.ps1

# Activate SSO on the dashboards (DONE — injects SSO_SECRET/CLIENT_KEY into all 10). Stays INERT:
# the proxy delivers no-second-password today, and the cookie only takes over if each dashboard
# also gets its own <c>.bidbrain.ai subdomain (see "To turn on cookie SSO" below):
.\scripts\enable_platform_sso.ps1

# To turn on cookie-based SSO later (only needed if you give each dashboard its own subdomain):
#   1. Host the bidbrain.ai zone wherever DNS lives (Cloudflare DNS today, or Cloud DNS).
#   2. `gcloud beta run domain-mappings create --service=<c>-dash --domain=<c>.bidbrain.ai --region=australia-southeast1`
#      for each dashboard (Google auto-issues managed TLS). australia-southeast1 IS supported.
#   3. Add the returned records; update the registry URLs to https://<c>.bidbrain.ai/.

# Redeploy the platform after a code/template edit (data edits use the admin UI, not a redeploy):
.\bidbrain-platform\dash\deploy_dash_platform.ps1

# Re-seed the registry from config.py (rare; refuses to clobber live edits unless --force):
$env:GCS_BUCKET="bidbrain-analytics-platform-dash"; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe bidbrain-platform\dash\seed_registry.py

# Enable the super-admin god-mode console (one-time, AFTER deploying the new image — see "Super admin"):
.\scripts\enable_super_admin.ps1 -SuperPw 'a-strong-password'

# Enable native "Sign in with Google" (one-time; create the OAuth client in the Console first — see
# "Sign in with Google"). Re-runnable; password login is unaffected:
.\scripts\enable_google_login.ps1 -ClientId '1234...apps.googleusercontent.com'

# Enable native "Sign in with Microsoft" (one-time; create the Entra app registration first — see
# "Sign in with Microsoft"). Re-runnable; password + Google login unaffected:
.\scripts\enable_microsoft_login.ps1 -ClientId '<application-client-id>' -Tenant '<directory-tenant-id>'
```

## Local dev (no GCP)
```powershell
$env:PLATFORM_BACKEND="memory"; $env:DEV="1"; $env:SESSION_SECRET="x"; $env:SSO_SECRET="y"; $env:COOKIE_DOMAIN=""
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe bidbrain-platform\dash\main.py   # needs Flask in the env; serves on :8080
```
`PLATFORM_BACKEND=memory` loads `config.py` into an in-process store (edits lost on restart).

## Hardening / known trade-offs
Reviewed adversarially; the items below are deliberate trade-offs for an internal, admin-gated
front door, not open bugs:
- **No in-app login rate-limiting.** `/login` (here and on every client dash) doesn't throttle —
  matching the repo's existing posture. Mitigate at the edge: turn on **Cloudflare rate-limiting /
  WAF** for `dashboards.bidbrain.ai`, and **set a strong `ADMIN_PW`** before seeding (the default
  `bidbrain-admin-2026` is a placeholder). Agency passwords are your chosen values.
- **SSO grant is a stateless 12h signed cookie.** Deleting an agency / detaching a client / rotating
  a password doesn't revoke already-issued `bb_sso` cookies until they expire (≤12h). For an
  immediate offboard, also rotate that dashboard's own `<c>-dash-password` (its password is always
  the real gate; SSO is additive). Rotating `platform-sso-key` revokes *everything* at once.
- **Campaigns are edited by positional index.** Two admins editing the same client's campaigns
  concurrently (or from a stale tab) can mis-edit a row. Single-admin use makes this unlikely; it's
  a recoverable registry edit, not data loss.
- **Super admin stores recoverable plaintext passwords.** To let the god-mode console *reveal*
  passwords (a pbkdf2 hash can't be un-hashed), the registry keeps a `password_plain` beside each
  hash. This is a deliberate choice scoped to the **private** registry — the same trust boundary that
  already stores every dashboard's plaintext `<c>-dash-password` secret — and gated behind the
  super-admin password. The pbkdf2 hash is still what `/login` verifies against; the plaintext is
  reveal-only. There is **no committed default** super-admin password — `SUPER_ADMIN_PW` defaults to
  empty so an unconfigured deploy fails *closed*; `enable_super_admin.ps1` takes `-SuperPw` (or mints
  a random one). Super admin is god-mode by design: it can rotate the **real** standalone dashboard
  secrets and restart those services.

## Cost
One scale-to-zero Cloud Run service ≈ **$0/mo** (free tier), or **~$13–16/mo** if you set
`min-instances=1` to avoid the ~1–3s cold start. The registry is one tiny JSON in GCS (a few KB) ≈
$0. Cloudflare DNS/proxy is free. No database, no load balancer.
