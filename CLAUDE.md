# CLAUDE.md — Bidbrain Analytics

Monorepo of self-hosted client marketing dashboards on GCP. One repeatable pattern,
many clients: **MongoDB is the template**; **Cloudflare** and **STT** are copies of it.
The root `README.md` is the full map — this file is the fast-path for the edits we do most.

## Fixed facts (memorize; never re-derive)
- GCP project: `bidbrain-analytics` (project # 516554645957)
- Region: `australia-southeast1` — **EVERYTHING**, never another region.
- Artifact Registry docker repo: `bidbrain` (shared by all clients)
- Local dev: Windows + PowerShell. Use the repo venv: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`
- Per client `<c>` everything derives from the key: dataset `client_<c>`,
  bucket `bidbrain-analytics-<c>-dash`, export job `<c>-export`, web service `<c>-dash`,
  subdomain `<c>.bidbrain.ai`. (`<c>` ∈ {mongodb, cloudflare, stt})

## Dashboard edits — the common task. READ THIS FIRST.
Each client's UI is ONE big file: `client_<c>/dash/dashboard.html` (~1,300–1,700 lines).

- **Do NOT read, reformat, or edit the logo blocks.** They are static, enormous, and never
  change: a wall of `<svg … aria-label="…"><path …></svg>` (STT, MongoDB) or an inline
  `<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,…">` (Cloudflare). The STT logo SVG is **duplicated** in
  `client_STT/dash/main.py` (LOGIN_HTML) — same rule there.
- **grep to the target** (a chart canvas `id`, a KPI element `id`, a render function name)
  and edit in place. Don't slurp the whole file to change a colour/label/card.
- Pure visual tweaks (colours, labels, spacing, a new card) live entirely in `dashboard.html`.
  Colours are CSS vars in `:root` at the top.

## The data contract — when an edit needs NEW data, not just layout
A value on screen traces through three files, matched **by name**:

    sql/*.sql view column  →  job/main.py (the env={…} dict key)  →  dashboard.html (data.* key)

So "add metric X" is usually three edits: surface it in the right `sql/*.sql` view, expose it
in `job/main.py`, THEN render it in `dashboard.html`. Editing only the HTML renders nothing.
Renaming a key anywhere breaks the next stage — fix both ends.

## Redeploy after an edit — manual. Do NOT use cloudbuild from a laptop.
`gcloud builds submit --config .../cloudbuild.yaml` FAILS from a laptop
(`iam.serviceaccounts.actAs` — Cloud Build's SA can't act as the runtime SA). Those configs
are for a future push-to-main trigger. Build the image, deploy as yourself:

    # edited dashboard.html or dash/main.py → rebuild + redeploy the SERVICE:
    $IMG = "australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/bidbrain-analytics/bidbrain/<c>-dash:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
    gcloud builds submit client_<c>/dash --tag $IMG --region australia-southeast1
    gcloud run services update <c>-dash --image $IMG --region australia-southeast1

    # edited a sql/*.sql view → reapply views + re-run the JOB (no service redeploy):
    .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe client_<c>\create_views.py
    gcloud run jobs execute <c>-export --region australia-southeast1 --wait

    # edited job/main.py (the JSON shape) → rebuild + deploy + run the JOB:
    $IMG = "australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/bidbrain-analytics/bidbrain/<c>-export:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
    gcloud builds submit client_<c>/job --tag $IMG --region australia-southeast1
    gcloud run jobs deploy <c>-export --image $IMG --region australia-southeast1 `
      --service-account <c>-dash-job@bidbrain-analytics.iam.gserviceaccount.com --memory 1Gi
    gcloud run jobs execute <c>-export --region australia-southeast1 --wait

The service serves `dashboard.html` with `Cache-Control: no-store`, so a redeploy shows
immediately. The service always reads whatever JSON is currently in the bucket.

## Never
- Never commit secrets/keys (`*.p8`, `*credentials*.json`, `.env`, bare `*_key`). They live in
  Secret Manager + the local `bidbrain-vault/` (gitignored).
- Never make the data JSON public. The private bucket + the Flask password gate IS the security
  model — don't regress to the old public-R2 pattern.
- Never edit views in the BigQuery console. `sql/*.sql` is the source of truth or they drift.
